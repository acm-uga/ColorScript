### Customize your terminal

## Activity Outline
Classic terminal prompts will typically look like this:
```
brandonyau@Brandons-MacBook-Air-2 ColorScript %  
```
We want to customize our terminal prompt to have a color for the name and also show
the present working directory of the user for ease of access.
This activity will require you to change your .zshrc or .bashrc files
